        <p>
        I am a senior in the BFA program for Digital Art and Animation at Lousiana State University. 
        I became passionate about art at an early age, and I realized that it is what I want to do with my life when I was 
        about 14.  I enjoy all types of art and creation, but my ideal career is one involved in the car-design process. 
        My dad got me into cars when I was young and I became interested in motorcycles as well after watching the 2010's Tron: Legacy. 
        I became a Christian my freshman year of college and as such I believe that I should work as if I were working for God in all that I do,
        and in that I aim to do my best in any work that I have before me.  I love cars, motorcycles, creating art, sports, rock climbing, reading, 
        and Jesus.
